### A. Evaluation Criteria:

To measure chatbot accuracy comprehensively, we will use a combination of evaluation criteria that assess both objective and subjective aspects of chatbot performance. The evaluation criteria will include:

1.	Speed of Code Retrieval:
"Speed of code retrieval" refers to the efficiency and swiftness with which a chatbot system can retrieve and provide relevant code snippets or programming solutions in response to user queries or requests related to coding and programming tasks. This capability is especially relevant for chatbots designed to assist programmers, developers, and individuals seeking technical help in coding-related matters.
2.	Lines of Code: 
The number of lines of code a program includes can have a big impact on how effective it is. While there isn't a rule that shorter codes are always more effective, there are a number of aspects connected to code length that can affect a piece of code's performance, readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
3.	Syntax Analysis:
The syntax of code directly influences its efficiency. Proper syntax ensures accurate execution, while improper syntax can lead to errors and performance issues. Clean, well-structured syntax enhances readability, maintainability, and reduces the likelihood of bugs, resulting in more efficient and effective code.
4.	Completeness: 
Code completeness is crucial for efficiency. Incomplete code leads to runtime errors and unexpected behavior. Missing components or logic gaps hinder execution, causing inefficiencies. Complete code ensures smooth execution, reducing debugging time and enhancing overall efficiency.
